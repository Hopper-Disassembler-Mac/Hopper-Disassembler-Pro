Hopper Disassembler is a professional reverse engineering platform designed for deep binary analysis. This comprehensive tool transforms executable files into readable pseudo-code, supports multiple CPU architectures including x86, x86_64, ARM, and provides sophisticated debugging capabilities for both macOS and Linux environments.

The application stands out with its powerful static analysis features that automatically detect and label functions, variables, and data structures. Its interactive graph view presents control flow in an intuitive visual format, while the built-in decompiler generates pseudo-code that closely resembles original source code. Advanced users can extend functionality through Python scripting, enabling automated analysis workflows and custom processing of binary files.

Ideal for security professionals, software developers, and researchers, Hopper Disassembler offers unparalleled insight into compiled applications without access to original source code. The tool handles various file formats including Mach-O, ELF, PE, and more, making it versatile for different analysis scenarios across operating systems.
